title: /devblog/ Very Early Development

For the very first devblog, I thought I’d jump right into what’s going on at Zen Dao Games.  

I’m working on a game inspired by RPGs, Tower Defense, and Survival games. I also love cooperative experiences, so you’ll be able to play with your friends as well. How many? I have no idea, it’s in Very Early Development.

#### What will this game be?

While the end result is impossible to know, here’s what I’m aiming for:


- Single player or coop experience
- RPG-like character advancement through gear, items, and spells
- Adventure outside of your camp to explore the world and discover secrets and encounters
- Waves of mobs attack your camp at intervals, increasingly becoming more dangerous
- Defending the camp becomes increasingly more important and challenging
- Instead of the player doing all of the labor, a friendly NPC helps you
- Use the NPC to craft and enhance gear to become stronger
- Ask the NPC to build structures that expand the camp into a formidable defensive outpost
- Seek the NPC for quests that guide the story and adventuring opportunities
- High-five the NPC for being awesome (critical feature!)

There’s a whole list of other ideas I have, but I think this sums up the main game loop.


#### What progress has been made?

I did say it was in Very Early Development, right?

It’s truly very early, but here’s what I do have so far:

- A demo map for developing the core features
- Third Person Controller so the player can walk, run, jump, and attack
- A few different monster types that spawn, wander, aggro, attack, die, and drop loot
- Questing and dialogue systems
- NPC that acts as a quest hub for kicking off the story and guiding the player through some things
- Very primitive build system


#### Will this even be fun?

I sure hope so! 

I’m excited at the idea of playing such a game with my friends, which is why I started making it. And, I sincerely hope you are excited now, too.

Thanks for reading.
