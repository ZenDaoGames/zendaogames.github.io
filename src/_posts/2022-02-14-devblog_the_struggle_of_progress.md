Progress is hard. 

Sometimes it’s hard because of the challenge being faced. 
Sometimes it’s hard because focusing can be difficult. 
But sometimes… it’s hard because every step of progress uncovers a leap of doubt.

This is about the struggle of progress.

For example, I recently successfully wired up an end-to-end quest using Pixel Crusher’s Dialogue System and Quest Machine, and Opsive’s Ultimate Character Controller (wonderful assets, yet complicated to learn). This effort took several days of learning and trying and failing and adjusting- but eventually I got there. The dialogue is great, the quest is functional, the player can trigger events to update counters- it’s all coming together.  Sure, it’s not perfect- but those tweaks can come later. 

Progress!

But now, I know what it took to make that progress happen. The amount of effort I needed to put into that single, really simple from the player’s perspective, quest. Sure, the next one will be easier for me- but not a magnitude easier. It will take time and effort, and likely more trying and failing and learning. That step of progress has uncovered a leap of doubt…

Will I even be able to finish this endeavor?

This is what I mean by the struggle of progress. Sometimes what we achieve only highlights what’s left to do- and often with more knowledge about what is needed to do it. The more you do, the more you know what you need to do. 

For a solo indie game developer, the hills of progress uncover the mountains hidden behind them. There’s an endless amount of learning and failing and trying to fight for every bit of progress that can be made. This amount of energy invested can cause doubt that it’s possible, or reasonable, to continue on.

For me- and many others, hopefully even you- it is. Because those bits of progress, no matter how small, refill our energy bars without fail. The mountains of doubt are simply the princess being in another castle, so we’ll continue on until we finally find her.  

And then our quest will be over.
